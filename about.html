      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Have you ever experienced that feeling when you're practicing one part of the song, yet cannot go back to the beginning of that part easily? Have you ever have to practice on Guitar Pro with its bland and fake feeling and want to play along with the actual song instead? Then Cacophony is the app for you!</p>
      
      <h2>About Cacophony</h2>
      <p>Cacophony is an utility tool created to help people who are practicing musical instruments by playing the mp3 file alongside the Guitar Pro sheet. Every notes of the sheet is synced with the mp3 file, so you can easily jump to that part of the song that you want to practice, and loop it if you want! It also comes with a speed changer so you can easily practice your favorite song!</p>

      <h2>Credit</h2>
      <p>Cacophony cannot be made without <a href="https://alphatab.net/">AlphaTab</a>, an open-source software that display and play Guitar Pro sheet as well as other music notation files.</p>

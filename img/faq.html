      <h2>My Audio file and Sheet file doesn't sync</h2>
      <p>The app cannot automatically sync the files for you, it can only play both file at the same time. If they are out of sync, then you can change the Delay value at the bottom of the app, or at the Import window (will need to be reimported)</p>
      <p>The app can get out of sync while changing tracks or while the computer is being laggy, click on any notes or use the Left or Right Arrow key to re-sync it.</p>
